# Agent Skills

**Production-grade engineering skills for AI coding agents.**

Skills encode the workflows, quality gates, and best practices that senior engineers use when building software. These ones are packaged so AI agents follow them consistently across every phase of development.

## Commands

7 slash commands that map to the development lifecycle. Each one activates the right skills automatically.

| What you're doing | Command | Key principle |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| Define what to build | `/spec` | Spec before code |
| Plan how to build it | `/plan` | Small, atomic tasks |
| Build incrementally | `/build` | One slice at a time |
| Prove it works | `/test` | Tests are proof |
| Review before merge | `/review` | Improve code health |
| Simplify the code | `/code-simplify` | Clarity over cleverness |
| Ship to production | `/ship` | Faster is safer |

Skills also activate automatically based on what you're doing — designing an API triggers `api-and-interface-design`, building UI triggers `frontend-ui-engineering`, and so on.

## All 22 Skills

The commands above are entry points. The pack includes 22 skills total — 21 lifecycle skills plus the `using-agent-skills` meta-skill. Each skill is a structured workflow with steps, verification gates, and anti-rationalization tables. You can also reference any skill directly.

### Meta - Discover which skill applies

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |

# Using agent-skills with Windsurf

## Setup

### Project Rules

Windsurf uses `.windsurfrules` for project-specific agent instructions:

```bash
# Create a combined rules file from your most important skills
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md > .windsurfrules
echo "\n---\n" >> .windsurfrules
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md >> .windsurfrules
echo "\n---\n" >> .windsurfrules
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md >> .windsurfrules
```

### Global Rules

For skills you want across all projects, add them to Windsurf's global rules:

1. Open Windsurf → Settings → AI → Global Rules
2. Paste the content of your most-used skills

## Recommended Configuration

Keep `.windsurfrules` focused on 2-3 essential skills to stay within context limits:

```
# .windsurfrules
# Essential agent-skills for this project

[Paste test-driven-development SKILL.md]

---

[Paste incremental-implementation SKILL.md]

---

[Paste code-review-and-quality SKILL.md]
```

## Usage Tips

1. **Be selective** — Windsurf's context is limited. Choose skills that address your biggest quality gaps.
2. **Reference in conversation** — Paste additional skill content into the chat when working on specific phases (e.g., paste `security-and-hardening` when building auth).
3. **Use references as checklists** — Paste `references/security-checklist.md` and ask Windsurf to verify each item.


# FILE: docs/opencode-setup.md

# OpenCode Setup

This guide explains how to use Agent Skills with OpenCode in a way that closely mirrors the Claude Code experience (automatic skill selection, lifecycle-driven workflows, and strict process enforcement).

## Overview

OpenCode supports custom `/commands`, but does not have a native plugin system or automatic skill routing like Claude Code.

Instead, we achieve parity through:

- A strong system prompt (`AGENTS.md`)
- The built-in `skill` tool
- Consistent skill discovery from the `/skills` directory

This creates an **agent-driven workflow** where skills are selected and executed automatically.

While it is possible to recreate `/spec`, `/plan`, and other commands in OpenCode, this integration intentionally uses an agent-driven approach instead:

- Skills are selected automatically based on intent
- Workflows are enforced via `AGENTS.md`
- No manual command invocation is required

This more closely matches how Claude Code behaves in practice, where skills are triggered automatically rather than manually.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
```

2. Open the project in OpenCode.

3. Ensure the following files are present in your workspace:

- `AGENTS.md` (root)
- `skills/` directory

No additional installation is required.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Skill Discovery

All skills live in:

```
skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

OpenCode agents are instructed (via `AGENTS.md`) to:

- Detect when a skill applies
- Invoke the `skill` tool
- Follow the skill exactly

### 2. Automatic Skill Invocation

The agent evaluates every request and maps it to the appropriate skill.

Examples:

- "build a feature" → `incremental-implementation` + `test-driven-development`
- "design a system" → `spec-driven-development`
- "fix a bug" → `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- "review this code" → `code-review-and-quality`

The user does **not** need to explicitly request skills.

### 3. Lifecycle Mapping (Implicit Commands)

The development lifecycle is encoded implicitly:

- DEFINE → `spec-driven-development`
- PLAN → `planning-and-task-breakdown`
- BUILD → `incremental-implementation` + `test-driven-development`
- VERIFY → `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- REVIEW → `code-review-and-quality`
- SHIP → `shipping-and-launch`

This replaces slash commands like `/spec`, `/plan`, etc.

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Feature Development

User:
```
Add authentication to this app
```

Agent behavior:
- Detects feature work
- Invokes `spec-driven-development`
- Produces a spec before writing code
- Moves to planning and implementation skills

---

### Example 2: Bug Fix

User:
```
This endpoint is returning 500 errors
```

Agent behavior:
- Invokes `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- Reproduces → localizes → fixes → adds guards

---

### Example 3: Code Review

User:
```
Review this PR
```

Agent behavior:
- Invokes `code-review-and-quality`
- Applies structured review (correctness, design, readability, etc.)

---

## Agent Expectations (Critical)

For OpenCode to work correctly, the agent must follow these rules:

- Always check if a skill applies before acting
- If a skill applies, it MUST be used
- Never skip required workflows (spec, plan, test, etc.)
- Do not jump directly to implementation

These rules are enforced via `AGENTS.md`.

---

## Limitations

- No native slash commands (handled via intent mapping instead)
- No plugin system (handled via prompt + structure)
- Skill invocation depends on model compliance

Despite these, the workflow closely matches Claude Code in practice.

---

## Recommended Workflow

Just use natural language:

- "Design a feature"
- "Plan this change"
- "Implement this"
- "Fix this bug"
- "Review this"

The agent will automatically select and execute the correct skills.

---

## Summary

OpenCode integration works by combining:

- Structured skills (this repo)
- Strong agent rules (`AGENTS.md`)
- Automatic skill invocation via reasoning

This results in a **fully agent-driven, production-grade engineering workflow** without requiring plugins or manual commands.


# FILE: docs/getting-started.md

# Getting Started with agent-skills

agent-skills works with any AI coding agent that accepts Markdown instructions. This guide covers the universal approach. For tool-specific setup, see the dedicated guides.

## How Skills Work

Each skill is a Markdown file (`SKILL.md`) that describes a specific engineering workflow. When loaded into an agent's context, the agent follows the workflow — including verification steps, anti-patterns to avoid, and exit criteria.

**Skills are not reference docs.** They're step-by-step processes the agent follows.

## Quick Start (Any Agent)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
```

### 2. Choose a skill

Browse the `skills/` directory. Each subdirectory contains a `SKILL.md` with:
- **When to use** — triggers that indicate this skill applies
- **Process** — step-by-step workflow
- **Verification** — how to confirm the work is done
- **Common rationalizations** — excuses the agent might use to skip steps
- **Red flags** — signs the skill is being violated

### 3. Load the skill into your agent

Copy the relevant `SKILL.md` content into your agent's system prompt, rules file, or conversation. The most common approaches:

**System prompt:** Paste the skill content at the start of the session.

**Rules file:** Add skill content to your project's rules file (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, etc.).

**Conversation:** Reference the skill when giving instructions: "Follow the test-driven-development process for this change."

### 4. Use the meta-skill for discovery

Start with the `using-agent-skills` skill loaded. It contains a flowchart that maps task types to the appropriate skill.

## Recommended Setup

### Minimal (Start here)

Load three essential skills into your rules file:

1. **spec-driven-development** — For defining what to build
2. **test-driven-development** — For proving it works
3. **code-review-and-quality** — For verifying quality before merge

These three cover the most critical quality gaps in AI-assisted development.

### Full Lifecycle

For comprehensive coverage, load skills by phase:

```
Starting a project:  spec-driven-development → planning-and-task-breakdown
During development:  incremental-implementation + test-driven-development
Before merge:        code-review-and-quality + security-and-hardening
Before deploy:       shipping-and-launch
```

### Context-Aware Loading

Don't load all skills at once — it wastes context. Load skills relevant to the current task:

- Working on UI? Load `frontend-ui-engineering`
- Debugging? Load `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- Setting up CI? Load `ci-cd-and-automation`

## Skill Anatomy

Every skill follows the same structure:

```
YAML frontmatter (name, description)
├── Overview — What this skill does
├── When to Use — Triggers and conditions
├── Core Process — Step-by-step workflow
├── Examples — Code samples and patterns
├── Common Rationalizations — Excuses and rebuttals
├── Red Flags — Signs the skill is being violated
└── Verification — Exit criteria checklist
```

See [skill-anatomy.md](skill-anatomy.md) for the full specification.

## Using Agents

The `agents/` directory contains pre-configured agent personas:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `code-reviewer.md` | Five-axis code review |
| `test-engineer.md` | Test strategy and writing |
| `security-auditor.md` | Vulnerability detection |

Load an agent definition when you need specialized review. For example, ask your coding agent to "review this change using the code-reviewer agent persona" and provide the agent definition.

## Using Commands

The `.claude/commands/` directory contains slash commands for Claude Code:

| Command | Skill Invoked |
|---------|---------------|
| `/spec` | spec-driven-development |
| `/plan` | planning-and-task-breakdown |
| `/build` | incremental-implementation + test-driven-development |
| `/test` | test-driven-development |
| `/review` | code-review-and-quality |
| `/ship` | shipping-and-launch |

## Using References

The `references/` directory contains supplementary checklists:

| Reference | Use With |
|-----------|----------|
| `testing-patterns.md` | test-driven-development |
| `performance-checklist.md` | performance-optimization |
| `security-checklist.md` | security-and-hardening |
| `accessibility-checklist.md` | frontend-ui-engineering |

Load a reference when you need detailed patterns beyond what the skill covers.

## Spec and task artifacts

The `/spec` and `/plan` commands create working artifacts (`SPEC.md`, `tasks/plan.md`, `tasks/todo.md`). Treat them as **living documents** while the work is in progress:

- Keep them in version control during development so the human and the agent have a shared source of truth.
- Update them when scope or decisions change.
- If your repo doesn’t want these files long‑term, delete them before merge or add the folder to `.gitignore` — the workflow doesn’t require them to be permanent.

## Tips

1. **Start with spec-driven-development** for any non-trivial work
2. **Always load test-driven-development** when writing code
3. **Don't skip verification steps** — they're the whole point
4. **Load skills selectively** — more context isn't always better
5. **Use the agents for review** — different perspectives catch different issues


# FILE: docs/copilot-setup.md

# Using agent-skills with GitHub Copilot

## Setup

### Copilot Instructions

Copilot supports creating agent skills using a `.github/skills`, `.claude/skills`, or `.agents/skills` directory in your repository.

```bash
mkdir -p .github

# Create files for essential skills
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md > .github/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md > .github/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md
```

For more details, refer [Creating agent skills for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/create-skills).

### Agent Personas (agents.md)

Copilot supports specialized agent personas. Use the agent-skills agents:

```bash
# Copy agent definitions
cp /path/to/agent-skills/agents/code-reviewer.md .github/agents/code-reviewer.md
cp /path/to/agent-skills/agents/test-engineer.md .github/agents/test-engineer.md
cp /path/to/agent-skills/agents/security-auditor.md .github/agents/security-auditor.md
```

Invoke agents in Copilot Chat:
- `@code-reviewer Review this PR`
- `@test-engineer Analyze test coverage for this module`
- `@security-auditor Check this endpoint for vulnerabilities`

### Custom Instructions (User Level)

For skills you want across all repositories:

1. Open VS Code → Settings → GitHub Copilot → Custom Instructions
2. Add your most-used skill summaries

## Recommended Configuration

### .github/copilot-instructions.md

GitHub Copilot supports project-level instructions via `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

```markdown
# Project Coding Standards

## Testing
- Write tests before code (TDD)
- For bugs: write a failing test first, then fix (Prove-It pattern)
- Test hierarchy: unit > integration > e2e (use the lowest level that captures the behavior)
- Run `npm test` after every change

## Code Quality
- Review across five axes: correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance
- Every PR must pass: lint, type check, tests, build
- No secrets in code or version control

## Implementation
- Build in small, verifiable increments
- Each increment: implement → test → verify → commit
- Never mix formatting changes with behavior changes

## Boundaries
- Always: Run tests before commits, validate user input
- Ask first: Database schema changes, new dependencies
- Never: Commit secrets, remove failing tests, skip verification
```

### Specialized Agents

Use the agents for targeted review workflows in Copilot Chat.

## Usage Tips

1. **Keep instructions concise** — Copilot instructions work best when focused. Summarize the key rules rather than including full skill files.
2. **Use agents for review** — The code-reviewer, test-engineer, and security-auditor agents are designed for Copilot's agent model.
3. **Reference in chat** — When working on a specific phase, paste the relevant skill content into Copilot Chat for context.
4. **Combine with PR reviews** — Set up Copilot to review PRs using the code-reviewer agent persona.


# FILE: docs/skill-anatomy.md

# Skill Anatomy

This document describes the structure and format of agent-skills skill files. Use this as a guide when contributing new skills or understanding existing ones.

## File Location

Every skill lives in its own directory under `skills/`:

```
skills/
  skill-name/
    SKILL.md           # Required: The skill definition
    supporting-file.md # Optional: Reference material loaded on demand
```

## SKILL.md Format

### Frontmatter (Required)

```yaml
---
name: skill-name-with-hyphens
description: Guides agents through [task/workflow]. Use when [specific trigger conditions].
---
```

**Rules:**
- `name`: Lowercase, hyphen-separated. Must match the directory name.
- `description`: Start with what the skill does in third person, then include one or more clear "Use when" trigger conditions. Include both *what* and *when*. Maximum 1024 characters.

**Why this matters:** Agents discover skills by reading descriptions. The description is injected into the system prompt, so it must tell the agent both what the skill provides and when to activate it. Do not summarize the workflow — if the description contains process steps, the agent may follow the summary instead of reading the full skill.

### Standard Sections (Recommended Pattern)

```markdown
# Skill Title

## Overview
One-two sentences explaining what this skill does and why it matters.

## When to Use
- Bullet list of triggering conditions (symptoms, task types)
- When NOT to use (exclusions)

## [Core Process / The Workflow / Steps]
The main workflow, broken into numbered steps or phases.
Include code examples where they help.
Use flowcharts (ASCII) where decision points exist.

## [Specific Techniques / Patterns]
Detailed guidance for specific scenarios.
Code examples, templates, configuration.

## Common Rationalizations
| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| Excuse agents use to skip steps | Why the excuse is wrong |

## Red Flags
- Behavioral patterns indicating the skill is being violated
- Things to watch for during review

## Verification
After completing the skill's process, confirm:
- [ ] Checklist of exit criteria
- [ ] Evidence requirements
```

## Section Purposes

### Overview
The "elevator pitch" for the skill. Should answer: What does this skill do, and why should an agent follow it?

### When to Use
Helps agents and humans decide if this skill applies to the current task. Include both positive triggers ("Use when X") and negative exclusions ("NOT for Y").

### Core Process
The heart of the skill. This is the step-by-step workflow the agent follows. Must be specific and actionable — not vague advice.

**Good:** "Run `npm test` and verify all tests pass"
**Bad:** "Make sure the tests work"

### Common Rationalizations
The most distinctive feature of well-crafted skills. These are excuses agents use to skip important steps, paired with rebuttals. They prevent the agent from rationalizing its way out of following the process.

Think of every time an agent has said "I'll add tests later" or "This is simple enough to skip the spec" — those go here with a factual counter-argument.

### Red Flags
Observable signs that the skill is being violated. Useful during code review and self-monitoring.

### Verification
The exit criteria. A checklist the agent uses to confirm the skill's process is complete. Every checkbox should be verifiable with evidence (test output, build result, screenshot, etc.).

## Supporting Files

Create supporting files only when:
- Reference material exceeds 100 lines (keep the main SKILL.md focused)
- Code tools or scripts are needed
- Checklists are long enough to justify separate files

Keep patterns and principles inline when under 50 lines.

## Writing Principles

1. **Process over knowledge.** Skills are workflows, not reference docs. Steps, not facts.
2. **Specific over general.** "Run `npm test`" beats "verify the tests".
3. **Evidence over assumption.** Every verification checkbox requires proof.
4. **Anti-rationalization.** Every skip-worthy step needs a counter-argument in the rationalizations table.
5. **Progressive disclosure.** Main SKILL.md is the entry point. Supporting files are loaded only when needed.
6. **Token-conscious.** Every section must justify its inclusion. If removing it wouldn't change agent behavior, remove it.

## Naming Conventions

- Skill directories: `lowercase-hyphen-separated`
- Skill files: `SKILL.md` (always uppercase)
- Supporting files: `lowercase-hyphen-separated.md`
- References: stored in `references/` at the project root, not inside skill directories

## Cross-Skill References

Reference other skills by name:

```markdown
Follow the `test-driven-development` skill for writing tests.
If the build breaks, use the `debugging-and-error-recovery` skill.
```

Don't duplicate content between skills — reference and link instead.


# FILE: docs/cursor-setup.md

# Using agent-skills with Cursor

## Setup

### Option 1: Rules Directory (Recommended)

Cursor supports a `.cursor/rules/` directory for project-specific rules:

```bash
# Create the rules directory
mkdir -p .cursor/rules

# Copy skills you want as rules
cp /path/to/agent-skills/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md .cursor/rules/test-driven-development.md
cp /path/to/agent-skills/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md .cursor/rules/code-review-and-quality.md
cp /path/to/agent-skills/skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md .cursor/rules/incremental-implementation.md
```

Rules in this directory are automatically loaded into Cursor's context.

### Option 2: .cursorrules File

Create a `.cursorrules` file in your project root with the essential skills inlined:

```bash
# Generate a combined rules file
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md > .cursorrules
echo "\n---\n" >> .cursorrules
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md >> .cursorrules
```

## Recommended Configuration

### Essential Skills (Always Load)

Add these to `.cursor/rules/`:

1. `test-driven-development.md` — TDD workflow and Prove-It pattern
2. `code-review-and-quality.md` — Five-axis review
3. `incremental-implementation.md` — Build in small verifiable slices

### Phase-Specific Skills (Load on Demand)

For phase-specific work, create additional rule files as needed:

- `spec-development.md` -> `spec-driven-development/SKILL.md`
- `frontend-ui.md` -> `frontend-ui-engineering/SKILL.md`
- `security.md` -> `security-and-hardening/SKILL.md`
- `performance.md` -> `performance-optimization/SKILL.md`

Add these to `.cursor/rules/` when working on relevant tasks, then remove when done to manage context limits.

## Usage Tips

1. **Don't load all skills at once** - Cursor has context limits. Load 2-3 essential skills as rules and add phase-specific skills as needed.
2. **Reference skills explicitly** - Tell Cursor "Follow the test-driven-development rules for this change" to ensure it reads the loaded rules.
3. **Use agents for review** - Copy `agents/code-reviewer.md` content and tell Cursor to "review this diff using this code review framework."
4. **Load references on demand** - When working on performance, add `performance.md` to `.cursor/rules/` or paste the checklist content directly.

# Using agent-skills with Gemini CLI

## Setup

### Option 1: Install as Skills (Recommended)

Gemini CLI has a native skills system that auto-discovers `SKILL.md` files in `.gemini/skills/` or `.agents/skills/` directories. Each skill activates on demand when it matches your task.

**Install from the repo:**

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git --path skills
```

**Or install from a local clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
gemini skills install /path/to/agent-skills/skills/
```

**Install for a specific workspace only:**

```bash
gemini skills install /path/to/agent-skills/skills/ --scope workspace
```

Skills installed at workspace scope go into `.gemini/skills/` (or `.agents/skills/`). User-level skills go into `~/.gemini/skills/`.

Once installed, verify with:

```
/skills list
```

Gemini CLI injects skill names and descriptions into the prompt automatically. When it recognizes a matching task, it asks permission to activate the skill before loading its full instructions.

### Option 2: GEMINI.md (Persistent Context)

For skills you want always loaded as persistent project context (rather than on-demand activation), add them to your project's `GEMINI.md`:

```bash
# Create GEMINI.md with core skills as persistent context
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md > GEMINI.md
echo -e "\n---\n" >> GEMINI.md
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md >> GEMINI.md
```

You can also modularize by importing from separate files:

```markdown
# Project Instructions

@skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md
@skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md
```

Use `/memory show` to verify loaded context, and `/memory reload` to refresh after changes.

> **Skills vs GEMINI.md:** Skills are on-demand expertise that activate only when relevant, keeping your context window clean. GEMINI.md provides persistent context loaded for every prompt. Use skills for phase-specific workflows and GEMINI.md for always-on project conventions.

## Recommended Configuration

### Always-On (GEMINI.md)

Add these as persistent context for every session:

- `incremental-implementation` — Build in small verifiable slices
- `code-review-and-quality` — Five-axis review

### On-Demand (Skills)

Install these as skills so they activate only when relevant:

- `test-driven-development` — Activates when implementing logic or fixing bugs
- `spec-driven-development` — Activates when starting a new project or feature
- `frontend-ui-engineering` — Activates when building UI
- `security-and-hardening` — Activates during security reviews
- `performance-optimization` — Activates during performance work

## Advanced Configuration

### MCP Integration

Many skills in this pack leverage [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) tools to interact with the environment. For example:

- `browser-testing-with-devtools` uses the `chrome-devtools` MCP extension.
- `performance-optimization` can benefit from performance-related MCP tools.

To enable these, ensure you have the relevant MCP extensions installed in your Gemini CLI configuration (`~/.gemini/config.json`).

### Session Hooks

Gemini CLI supports session lifecycle hooks. You can use these to automatically inject context or run validation scripts at the start of a session.

To replicate the `agent-skills` experience from other tools, you can configure a `SessionStart` hook that reminds you of the available skills or loads a meta-skill.

### Explicit Context Loading

You can explicitly load any skill into your current session by referencing it with the `@` symbol in your prompt:

```markdown
Use the @skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md skill to implement this fix.
```

This is useful when you want to ensure a specific workflow is followed without waiting for auto-discovery.

## Slash Commands

The repo ships 7 slash commands under `.gemini/commands/` that map to the development lifecycle. Gemini CLI auto-discovers them when you run from the project root.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/spec` | Write a structured spec before writing code |
| `/planning` | Break work into small, verifiable tasks |
| `/build` | Implement the next task incrementally |
| `/test` | Run TDD workflow — red, green, refactor |
| `/review` | Five-axis code review |
| `/code-simplify` | Reduce complexity without changing behavior |
| `/ship` | Pre-launch checklist via parallel persona fan-out |

Each command invokes the corresponding skill automatically — no manual skill loading required.

> **Note:** Use `/planning` instead of `/plan` — `/plan` conflicts with a Gemini CLI internal command name.

## Usage Tips

1. **Prefer skills over GEMINI.md** — Skills activate on demand and keep your context window focused. Only put skills in GEMINI.md if you want them always loaded.
2. **Skill descriptions matter** — Each SKILL.md has a `description` field in its frontmatter that tells agents when to activate it. The descriptions in this repo are optimized for auto-discovery across all supported tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.) by clearly stating both *what* the skill does and *when* it should be triggered.
3. **Use agents for review** — Copy `agents/code-reviewer.md` content when requesting structured code reviews.
4. **Combine with references** — Reference checklists from `references/` when working on specific quality areas like testing or performance.
