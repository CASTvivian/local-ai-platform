## What are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that give AI agents specialized knowledge and workflows for specific tasks. When you add these to your project, your agent can recognize when you're working on a marketing task and apply the right frameworks and best practices.

## How Skills Work Together

Skills reference each other and build on shared context. The `product-marketing-context` skill is the foundation — every other skill checks it first to understand your product, audience, and positioning before doing anything.
